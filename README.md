## About
This boilerplate attempts to provide a useful collection of tools needed to build a responsive app that server-renders. The project is structured to be useful when there is the need to get moving - fast.

## Usage
First clone to local,
```
git clone https://github.com/cmdlucas/react-ssr-boilerplate.git
```

then install all dependencies with npm
```
npm install
```

You're all set!

## Nuggets
The project is intended to be very easy to use if you have a background in `Next.js` and `React`. You can catch up with the basics of Next.js [here](https://nextjs.org/learn) or begin learning react [here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

Some quick points to note however:

   - This is not a framework or library. It's just a boilerplate - everything can be reorganised and/or restructured to suit your own taste or unique needs.
   - The project's structure is self-explanatory. Notwithstanding, if you need more details on the structure in general, [see this blog post](http://blog.lucasbin.com/2019/03/02/server-side-rendering-react-and-next-js)
